I am a PhD student studying Human Development. My research focuses on the transformation that can be achieved through nature-based adventures. Through qualitative research, I explore the intricate pathways, mechanisms, and processes that underpin personal transformation. My ultimate goal is to share the captivating stories and insights of the women, contributing to a deeper understanding of the intricate connection between nature, personal growth, and well-being. I am passionate about this journey of discovery and exploration in the realm of human development and the great outdoors.

Additionally, I am a development coach, guiding individuals on transformative journeys. Sometimes, our sessions take place outdoors, in the heart of nature.
